Movie Recommendation System with Data Processing:

                   This GitHub repository contains Python code for building a movie recommendation system.
                   The program utilizes the Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
                   The "tmdb_5000_movies.csv" and "tmdb_5000_credits.csv" datasets are read and merged to create a comprehensive movie dataset.
                   The dataset is preprocessed by extracting relevant information such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew details.

Key Steps:

Data Loading: Reads movie data from CSV files and performs exploratory data analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Extracts and transforms genres, keywords, cast, and crew information using custom functions.
Text Processing: Converts and formats text data, removing spaces between words.
Feature Engineering: Creates a "tags" feature by combining movie overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew details.
Movie Recommendation: Defines a function to recommend similar movies based on calculated similarity scores.
The recommendation system suggests similar movies to a given title (e.g., 'Avatar'). The code showcases data cleaning, text processing, and recommendation logic. It demonstrates proficiency in handling movie data, extracting relevant features, and providing personalized movie recommendations.
